### Introduction
Congratulations on stumbling upon this repository! Here you'll find the chronicles of my adventures in learning C language in public and surviving the mind-numbing classes as part of my engineering degree.
Join me on this thrilling journey of sleep-deprived coding, caffeinated ventures, and the occasional existential crisis. Fun guaranteed (disclaimer: fun not actually guaranteed).

### Acknowledgments
Shoutout to caffeine for keeping me awake during lectures, Stack Overflow for saving my sanity countless times, and the sweet delusion that I'll actually use C language beyond this course. Oh, and to my engineering degree for constantly providing me with amusing anecdotes.
